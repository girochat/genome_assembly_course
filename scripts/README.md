# Script Directory
This directory contains all scripts used for the project. The main scripts necessary for the assembly and annotation parts can be found in each relevant subdirectory. The "misc" subdirectory contains all accessory scripts, containers, R and other libraries that were required throughout the main analysis.  
All the scripts, as well as the two main parts, are numbered according to the workflow of the project. Each script contains a header indicating how to run the script and which data files are necessary. In this project, all the data that was used can be found in the data directory.
