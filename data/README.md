# Data Directory
This directory contains all the data used for the project. Here is a brief description of each subdirectory:

* alignment  
  Alignment data (Illumina short-read mapped to assembly) in BAM format. 
* annotation  
  MAKER output for both Canu and Flye assemblies.
* assembly  
  Assembly FASTA files from Canu, Flye and Trinity as well as after polishing. 
* reads  
  Raw reads of genomic (Illumina paired-end and Pacbio CLR) and transcriptomic (Illumina RNAseq paired-end) data.
* reference  
  All TAIR10 reference files; i.e. reference genome, reference coding regions, modified version of reference genome. Swissprot plant protein sequence file.
* TE  
  EDTA whole-genome TE annotation both for Flye and Canu assemblies. Gypsy and Copia clades classification output by TESorter.
